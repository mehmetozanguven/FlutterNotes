# FlutterNotes

- To create an Flutter application `$ flutter create my_new_application` which will create a folder called `my_new_application`.
- After running device write `flutter run` or in VsCode, go to debug section click `start without debugging`

## File Structure of Flutter Application
- **.idea** = Holds some configuration for android studio.
- **.vscode** = Holds some configuration for visual studio.
- **android** = When flutter codes compiles to android native code, it will be injected to that folder
- **build** = Holds output of flutter application, generated and managed by Flutter SDK
- **ios** = Some with android but ios 
- **lib** = where we write our dart codes
- **test** = holds the test codes
- **.gitignore** = for git configuration
- **.metadata** =  Flutter saves some information in here which it needs to build our application correctly
- **.packages** = Flutter manages internal dependencies in here
- **pubspec.lock** = File that is generated by pubspec.yaml file
- **pubspec.yaml** = Folder where we add 3rd party packages and images, fonts 


## Widgets
- Widgets are components, the building blocks of our user interface
- Widget is a special type of object:
```dart 
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

void main(){
  runApp(MyApp());
}
 
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
  Widget build(BuildContext context){
      return MaterialApp();
   }
}
```

## Main method
- `void main(){}` is special method where dart programming starts

## runApp()
- runApp is a normal function but not written by us written by the Flutter team and it is in `material.dart`
- runApp tries to take our widget tree and draw something onto screen that's based on that tree.

## Data types in Dart
- Text => Strings
- Numbers => Integers = 2, 30 Floats/Doubles => 20.99

## Constructor
```dart
class Person{
  String name;
  int age;
  
  Person(String name, int age){
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
  }
  /// shortcut of the below constructor
  Person({this.name, this.age});
}
```

## Named Parameters
- Wrap your parameters with curly brackets `{ }`
```dart
void main(){
  runApp(MyApp());
}

void sample(name:'ozan', age:24);
void sample(age:22, name:'other');

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
  Widget build(BuildContext context){
      return MaterialApp();
   }
   
   void sample({String name, int age}){
   ///...
   }
}
```

### Default Parameters
```dart
void main(){
  runApp(MyApp());
}

void sample(name:'ozan', age:24);
void sample(age:22, name:'other');

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
  Widget build(BuildContext context){
      return MaterialApp();
   }
   
   void sample({String name='test', int age=30}){
   ///...
   }
}
```

### @required annotation
```dart
void main(){
  runApp(MyApp());
}

void sample(name:'ozan', age:24);
void sample(age:22, name:'other');

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget{
  Widget build(BuildContext context){
      return MaterialApp();
   }
   
   void sample({@required String name, @required int age}){
   ///...
